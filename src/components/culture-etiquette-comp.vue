            <li>Never use your left hand for anything. Don't touch anyone with it, don't eat with it, don't pick things up with it â€“ as it's considered the hand you use to wipe yourself in the bathroom. If you're left-handed and suddenly everyone looks at you with disgust, that's what's going through their minds.</li>
            <li>Remember to remove your shoes or sandals at the door to a house, and don't show the soles of your feet to anyone.</li>
            <li>Use your right thumb to point at things - pointing with the index finger is considered rude.</li>
            <li>Always bend slightly when meeting or greeting an Indonesian older than you or in a position of authority.</li>
            <li>Put your resting bitch-face away. Looking at someone the wrong way can be interpreted as disrespectful. </li>
