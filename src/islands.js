      des: `Due to its sheer size as the world’s 13th largest island, it should come as no surprise that Java falls within the top five of Indonesia’s largest islands. Surrounded by the Indian Ocean on one side and the Java Sea on the other, the island provides a home for over 140 million people – more than half of all of Indonesia’s population put together!

      The island of Java is a mix of different cultures, languages, and religions. The seat of countless Hindu-Buddhist empires and Islamic sultanates, Java has constantly been the site of historical importance and bloody battles.`

      des: `While not solely part of Indonesia (it is shared with the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste), the coffee-growing region of Timor can be found in the south of Maritime Southeast Asia. It is found above the Timor Sea, which divides it from the Australian mainland.

      The name Timor means ‘east’ in Malay; it is so-called because of its location as one of the easternmost islands of Indonesia’s Lesser Sunda archipelago. Unlike the rest of the island group, Timor is not volcanic and is much older.`

      island: 'Sumatra',
      size: '473,481 km<sup>2</sup>',
      img: '@/assets/sumatra.jpg',
      des: `Sumatra, also known as Sumatera, is the sixth-largest island in the world. Forming part of the Greater Sunda Islands in western Indonesia, it can be found to the west of Java and to the south of the Malay Peninsula. Sumatra is an island revered for its incredible biodiversity and gigantic volcanic crater lake – the largest in the world.

      Within its rainforests and volcanic terrain, there is some astonishing wildlife, such as the Sumatran orangutan, the Sumatran rhino, and the Sumatran tiger – all of which have been listed as critically endangered species.`
