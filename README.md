## Bug Fix
This project took me about 10 days to complete. During the development period, a large amount of time was spent for some unfamiliar bug fixes. Among many bugs I faced, there are 2 marjor bugs I experienced with this project that took **arduous** amount of debugging.

### **1) Apache Server Configuration**

As I'm using `Router History Mode`, and as this project is hosted through Hostinger under my main (portfolio) website, I needed to configure `publicPath` to indicate server fallback to `index.html`. This new concept wasn't too much of a hassle as I followed [Vue deployment documentation](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/deployment.html#deployment) to add vue.config.js.

The real problem though, emerged when I landed on [this](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/history-mode.html#html5-history-mode) part of documentation where I had to add `.htaccess` file in the root folder of this project. Having ZERO knowledge on Apache nor its `.htaccess` syntax, it took me 2 whole days to finally configure the file. (I had no luck with Stack Overflow either ðŸ˜¥). After numerous trial and error, [here](https://codepen.io/kevinmnm/pen/ZEWJdWO) is the final syntax that worked for my project.

### **2) Customizing `router-link` Style**

I inteded to remote default underline implemented in `router-link`. After numerous trial & error, I finally asked Stack Overflow to find out that the real issue was CSS `display`. [Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63526678/cannot-remove-underline-from-vue-router-link/63527152?noredirect=1#comment112335377_63527152) is my Stack Overflow question.
